    <h3>Oha Soup Recipe</h3>

    <p>Ingredients for Ora (Oha) Soup</p>

    <ul>

        <li> Vegetable: Ora leaves</li>
        <li> 8 small corms cocoyam</li>
        <li> 3 cooking spoons Red Palm Oil</li>
        <li> Assorted Beef: Includes best cut, shaki (cow tripe)</li>
        <li> Assorted Fish: Dry Fish and Stock Fish</li>
        <li> Chilli pepper, salt and crayfish (to taste)</li>
        <li> 2 Stock cubes</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon Ogiri Igbo</li>
        <li> Notes on the ingredients:</li>


    </ul>

    <p>Ora (Oha) is a unique vegetable hence does not have a good alternative.
        If you cannot buy cocoyam corms where you live, you can use cocoyam flour. An alternative to cocoyam flour is
        potato flour. See how to prepare the cocoyam flour or potato flour before adding it to your soup at: How to Cook
        Nigerian Soups with Flour as Thickener.
        Ogiri Igbo is optional, it gives Ora Soup a traditional taste.
        Before you cook the Nigerian Ora Soup
        Grind the crayfish and pepper and set aside.
        pound cocoyam
        Wash and boil the cocoyam corms till soft. Remove the peels and use a mortar and pestle to pound the corms to a
        smooth paste.
        Using your fingers, cut the Ora (Oha) leaves into tiny pieces. This technique is to prevent the vegetable from
        becoming darker in colour. This happens when you cut the ora leaves with a knife.

    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> Boil the shaki (cow tripe), stock fish and dry fish in 1 litre of water till they are well done. First sign
            of a done shaki is that the cuts will start curling on itself.</li>
        <li> Wash the beef and add to the pot of shaki etc. and continue cooking. When the meat is done, add 2 stock
            cubes and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add the pepper, ogiri Igbo and ground crayfish and cook for 10 minutes. Add the cocoyam paste in small
            lumps and then the palm oil.</li>
        <li> Cover the pot and leave to cook on high heat till all the cocoyam lumps have dissolved. You can add more
            water if you feel that the soup is too thick.</li>
        <li> Add the ora (oha) leaves and leave to cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add salt to taste, stir and the soup is ready!</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Serve with Garri (Eba), Semolina Fufu, Amala, Cassava Fufu or Pounded Yam</p>
